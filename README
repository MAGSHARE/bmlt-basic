DESCRIPTION
-----------

The Basic Meeting List Toolbox (BMLT) is a powerful, database-driven system for tracking NA meetings.
It is NOT an official product of NA ( http://na.org ). Rather, it is a project designed and implemented by
NA members, and meant to be used by official NA Service bodies.

This project implements a "standalone satellite." It does not have to be integrated into a content management
system.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

The project requires a functioning BMLT root server ( http://magshare.org/blog/installing-the-root-server/ ).
It does not implement a root server, but connects to an existing one.
It requires PHP 5.0 or above.

This class uses the BMLT Satellite Base Class, which is available on GitHub, here:

    https://github.com/MAGSHARE/BMLT-Satellite-Base-Class
    

INSTALLATION
------------

This is a super-simple implementation of the BMLT. The absolutely simplest file imaginable is here:

<?php require_once ( 'bmlt_basic.class.php' ); ?>
<head><?php $basic_bmlt_object->output_head('[[BMLT]]'); ?></head>
<body><?php $basic_bmlt_object->output_body(); ?></body>

CHANGELIST
----------
= 3.0 =
* TBD
* First release (version is to sync with the other satellite clients).
